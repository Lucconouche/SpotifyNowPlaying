Spotify Now Playing Geeklet
===========================

Nice AppleScript that helps GeekTool to show what's currently playing in Spotify.

Installation
------------

The content of the Pictures folder needs to go into the Pictures folder inside the home directory, eg. /Users/john/Pictures. You can place the script file there too if you want.

In GeekTool, you create a Shell Geeklet and an image Geeklet. The Image Geeklet needs to point to theArtwork.tiff in the Pictures folder. Set the size to 50\*50. 

For the Shell Geeklet, type this command :

	osascript pathToScriptFile

The refresh rate for can be between 1 to 5 seconds.
